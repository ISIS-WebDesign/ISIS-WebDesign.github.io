<p>I know we loved to hit the road and laugh<p>
<p>But something told me that it wouldn't last<p>
<p>Had to switch up<p>
<p>Look at things different, see the bigger picture<p>
<p>Those were the days<p>
<p>Hard work forever pays<p>
<p>Now I see you win the better place (see you win the better place)<p>

<p>{Yeah}<p>
<p>First you both go out your way<p>
<p>And the vibe is feeling strong<p>
<p>And what's small turn to a friendship<p>
<p>A friendship turn to a bond<p>
<p>And that bond will never be broken<p>
<p>The love will never get lost (and the love will never get lost)<p>
<p>And when brotherhood come first<p>
<p>Then the line will never be crossed<p>
<p>Established it on our own<p>
<p>When that line had to be drawn<p>
<p>And that line is what we reach<p>
<p>So remember me when I'm gone (remember me when I'm gone)<p>
